# Captioning-Flickr-Images-by-a-Hybrid-Neural-Network
Final project for Bio-Computing Course under Prof. Bagher BabaAli. Hybrid CNN-LSTM model for image captioning.

🎯 Objective

Generate captions for Flickr images using a hybrid CNN-LSTM approach

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python 3, PyTorch, ResNet18, LSTM, Word2Vec, Matplotlib, Pandas

📊 Results & Reflection

Fully trainable ResNet + LSTM yielded best results

Final Cross Entropy ≈ 1.9 over 20 epochs

Learned hybrid model training and vocabulary creation via Word2Vec
